Shiny is a new package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R.
A Shiny application is simply a directory containing an R script , which is made up of a user interface object ui.R and a server.R,helper.R function. These files contain any any additional data, scripts, or other resources required to support the application. 

### Minimum Hardware requirement
>  1) Processor AMD AthlonXP/Sempron or above  Intel pentium4 and above ,1.2 cache= 512kb minimum ,process 130nm minimum.
  
>  2) Memory 512Mb or above.

### Minimum Software requirement


> 1)	Java 1.7.0_03
> 2)	R 2.15(R 3.1 suggested )
> 3)	MySQL5.1.41(MySQL5.5 suggested)
> 4)	Framework R shiny installed

### All  Series Navigation (STEPS/PLANNING PROCESS)

> 1.	Planning the app: Basic idea & Design 
> 2.	Planning the App : database Architecture & development approach
> 3.	Designing the App: Workflow map and photoshop design 
> 4.	Designing the App : HTML ,CSS , R & JAVASCRIPT
> 5.	Developing the App :User Interface 
> 7.	Developing the App :List interaction
> 8.	Security & the future .

### Features:


> 1.Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs, without requiring a reload of the browser.

> 2.user interfaces is built entirely using R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for more flexibility.

> 3.Works in any R environment (Console R, Rgui for Windows or Mac, ESS, StatET, RStudio, etc.

> 4.Attractive default UI based on Twitter Bootstrap.

> 5.built output widgets for displaying plots, tables, and printed output of R objects.

> 6.Used a reactive programming model that eliminates messy event handling code, so user can focus on the code that really    matters,reactive programming is a coding style that starts with reactive values–values that change over time, or in response to the user–and builds on top of them with reactive expressions–expressions that access reactive values and execute other reactive expressions.

#### Installation
Shiny is available on CRAN, so you can install it in the usual way from your R console:

### Abstract:

We have provided a resource enabling interactive query and navigation of genomic datasets relevant to research on human immune system aging. Detailed information about studies and samples will be displayed dynamically; if desired the associated data can be downloaded with permission from Jackson laboratory. Custom interactive visualizations of the data can be shared via email with authorized permission. The application can be used to browse context-rich systems-scale data within and across systems Aging studies. A portion of the resource will be publicly available online.
